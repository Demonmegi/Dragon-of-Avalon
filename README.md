Story:

In the Year 249 a 12 Year war reached it's decisive moment at the Citadel of Avalon. The Alliance of Eurale, which include the Kingdoms of Aratoy, Cathea, Fornax, Elythria, Oriam, Nisos and Taberland all sent contingents of their own units, to defend the citadel. The Besiegers, the Sha'Ahoul Army from the distant steppes of the east finally breached the South gate of Avalon after a grueling 8 months Siege, but failed to capitalize and lost momentum. Their Leader Sha'men Mithras was trapped in the Outer Bailey of the Citadel and managed to defeat General Sir Roth Hildebrand in a duel. Later, his forces were worn down, since the defenders managed to shut the South Gate down, preventing any reinforcements to arrive. A Hero from Elythria enters the Outer Bailey with his brother, Lieutenant Corvus and the Blood Roses, who hold off the Sha'Ahoul Army. In a Duel, the Hero from Elythria finally defeats Mithras in an intense battle. The whereabout of his remains are unclear, but it is assumed that he was carried away by his loyal followers.

One year after the Siege, the war came to it's conclusion and the Kingdom of Oriam was now free from the invasion once again. Rebuilding the Kingdom would take time.

5 months later, while repairs of the Citadel of Avalon was still ongoing, a force deep in the forest north of the citadel stirs. The legendary Green Dragon has awakened and it's destructive power a threat to the citadel.

Avalon needs new Heroes to step up. Will you become one too?
